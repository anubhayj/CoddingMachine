### What is fizzBuzz
FizzBuzz is very common programming task, used in coding interviews , its like one of those screening questions.

## Problem
Problem : 
    Write a program that prints the number from 1 - 100.
    for every number which is divisible by 2 print FIZZ (or add to array or could be other variations)
    for every number which is divisible by 3 print BUZZ (or add to array or could be other variations)
    for every number which is divisible by both 2 / 3 print FIZZBUZZ (or add to array or could be other variations)

#Approaches
    Approach I : Naive appraoch
        ``` check func --->  fizzBuzz  in FizzBuzz.js ```
    Approach II : Competitive appraoch
        ``` check func --->  fizzBuzz  in FizzBuzz.js ```
    Wether to apply Module or not apply module is the key as it saves time complexity.

# Clone and Run
    Note : n is passed as args
    ``` node FIZZBUZZ.js 100 ```
